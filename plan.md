-   Email / SMS alerts when important events occur
-   User accounts and basic authentication / login

### Low Priority

-   Home & room setup wizard
-   View camera stream in-browser
-   IoT hardware demo (actual sensor reporting data to the system)
-   More comprehensive security, HTTPS, passwords are stored salt+hash

## Technologies
